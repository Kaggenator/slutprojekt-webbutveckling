                <h3>RollsRoyce Dawn</h3>
                <p>All-new Rolls-Royce’s don’t come along very often, so the Dawn is a very big deal. According to designer Giles Taylor, the objective of the open-top Wraith was to make its occupants look like rock stars. It’s named after the ultra-rare 1950s Silver Dawn and fills a newly emerging gap in Rolls’ portfolio: the Phantom Drophead Coupe is winding down and won’t be replaced until 2018. The Dawn thus leads the charge for a younger, more dynamic clientele. It’s more than just a Wraith soft-top too. 80 per cent of the body panels are unique and even the tyres are bespoke. It’s not for shrinking violets and is a jaw-dropping thing to behold in the flesh: needless to say, the quarter-million pound price tag is just the starting point.</p>

                <h3>RollsRoyce Ghost</h3>
                <p>The Ghost is a Rolls-Royce to take when the parking is tighter and the chauffeur’s got the day off. Smaller, in the same way a tanker is to a supertanker, the Ghost keeps Rolls-Royce’s imperious manner, but hides it behind slightly more bluff edges and not quite as aggrandising a front grille. Indeed, driven and specified conservatively, the Ghost doesn’t even draw that much attention from other drivers or passers-by. And those that do notice it don’t react with fury and vitriol, as they might to a Ferrari, Lamborghini or, perhaps, Rolls Phantom, but with respect and deference. You get let out of side-turnings, and nobody dare tailgate you. After all, you might be some lesser-known royal and therefore worthy of a measure of respect. Or you could have them killed. Coming from a company that still refers to its products as ‘motor cars’ the Ghost retains old-world charm and luxury despite being largely based on the last-generation BMW 7 Series. You’d never know it, though. Besides the iDrive infotainment system (which you can hide away with the press of a button) there is no obvious component sharing. They don’t drive alike either – the Rolls opting for comfort and waftiness over “The Ultimate Driving Machine’s” gauche and unstatesmanlike sportiness. How very vulgar.</p>

                <h3>RollsRoyce Phantom</h3>
                <p>Since the first Phantom appeared in 1925, Rolls-Royce Motor Cars has had its ups and downs. When the outgoing Phantom appeared at the stroke of midnight on January 1st 2003, the company even called it ‘the last great automotive adventure’. Maybe that should have been penultimate, because we’ve just driven the new car, and as internal combustion most likely won’t be around in another 14 years’ time, this really could be The One. Rolls-Royce reckons the Phantom is the barometer by which everyone else in the world of expensive luxury goods measures themselves, so the bar isn’t just raised here, it’s bejewelled and platinum-plated. You know when someone claims to be ‘the Rolls-Royce of watches/furniture/granite-kitchen-worktops’? Well, this is the Rolls-Royce of Rolls-Royces.</p>
